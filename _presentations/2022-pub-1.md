  Water distribution networks (WDN) are considered vulnerable to health violations and contamination events. To better predict such events, a real-time dynamic model—based on PDEs that capture transport and reaction of contamiants and disinfectants—can be instrumented. Such model is essentially a dynamic- and network-theoretic representation of water quality (WQ) states throughout a WDN. Although this model has been thoroughly studied in the recent literature, its control-theoretic properties (stability, controllability, and observability) are neither studied nor understood. Consequently, the objective of this work is to investigate and understand control-theoretic properties of WQ models in drinking WDN. This understanding yields improved placement of decontamination stations, WQ sensors, and ultimately better real-time regulation of water quality.
