  <p>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate working with Professor <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=ahmad-taha" target="_blank">Ahmad F. Taha</a> in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University.
  I am interested in the research and development of computational algorithms in civil and environmental infrastructure systems. 
  With a specific focus on hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and climate, my research designs dynamic control and network-theoretic algorithms for the resilient regulation and monitoring of natural and built water systems.

  Welcome to my homepage! If you are interested in my work or find any of my projects intriguing, please shoot me an email.

  <p>
  When Iâ€™m not on my laptop (and, unfortunately, sometimes even when I am!), I love exploring new coffee shops, spending quality time with family and friends, cooking, taking long walks, and hiking.
