  <p>
  I am a Staff Water Resources Engineer at Arcadis with a Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering from Vanderbilt University. 
  </p>
  # I am a Research Assistant working with Professor <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=ahmad-taha" target="_blank">Ahmad F. Taha</a> in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University.
  # I am interested in the research and development of computational algorithms in civil and environmental infrastructure systems. 
  # With a specific focus on hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and climate, my research designs dynamic control and network-theoretic algorithms for the resilient regulation and monitoring of natural and built water systems.
  <p>
  If you are interested in my work or find any of my projects intriguing, please shoot me an email.
  </p>
  <p>
  When I am not on my laptop (and, unfortunately, sometimes even when I am!), I love exploring new coffee shops, spending quality time with family and friends, cooking, taking long walks, and hiking.
