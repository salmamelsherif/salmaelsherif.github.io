    Visited Louisville Water Company and gave a talk on my research about advancing water quality monitoring and control in water distribution networks. Many thanks to Dr. Eric Zhu and the amazing team for their invitation and warm welcome. Gained valuable insights from a practical perspective and canâ€™t wait to share the experience and pictures!
