  This paper studies the problem of optimal geographic placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in drinking water distribution networks (WDNs), with a specific focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is indeed inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, and as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a simple algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The presented algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic system sciences and observability theory, and yields sensor placements that are robust to hydraulic changes. Thorough case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.
