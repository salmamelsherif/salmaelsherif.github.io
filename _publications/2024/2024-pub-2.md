  Efficient water quality (WQ) control in distribution networks is pivotal for ensuring the delivery of safe and clean drinking water to consumers. Attaining this goal is complex due to the inherent intricacies of WQ systems, which often pose substantial challenges to achieving full controllability over their dynamics. Controllability, in this context, refers to the ability to effectively steer, regulate, and maintain disinfectant levels within the network to consistently meet the established water health standards. In addition, hydraulic conditions play a crucial role in influencing the level of WQ controllability. Hydraulic settings, including flow rates and directions, pressures, and network components, have a direct impact on how water quality dynamics propagate thereby influencing its controllability. In this study, we explore various metrics that provide both qualitative and quantitative assessments of water quality systems controllability. We examine the applicability of these metrics to the water quality systems taking into consideration network topology, booster stationsâ€™ locations, and changes in hydraulic settings. By applying a comprehensive framework to various case studies, we assess the performance, practicality, and limitations of these metrics across different network configurations and scenarios. The outcomes of this assessment not only enable water system operators to evaluate the state of system controllability but also provide a pathway for leveraging these metrics to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of control and regulation strategies.
